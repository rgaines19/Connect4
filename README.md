# Connect4
This is a connect 4 project on arduino.
It will interface with an actual connect 4 gameboard by using push buttons and servos.

The game will have 3 difficultly levels.
Connect4.ino is the original C file for the game with 2 difficulties

Connect_4_Final_MEGA_Test_v2.ino is the complete working program that was used
at the Engineering Showcase.

Connect_4_Final_Due.ino is the program that has all three difficulty levels.
All it need is to port the servo commands and LED drivers and some status flags
to function properly.
